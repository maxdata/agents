{"task_id": 5, "task_name": "Excel data process", "prompt": "Write an excel data processing program based on streamlit and pandas. The screen first shows an excel file upload button. After the excel file is uploaded, use pandas to display its data content. The program is required to be concise, easy to maintain, and not over-designed. It uses streamlit to process web screen displays, and pandas is sufficient to process excel reading and display. Please make sure others can execute directly without introducing additional packages."}
{"task_id": 6, "task_name": "CRUD manage", "prompt": "Write a management program based on the crud addition, deletion, modification and query processing of the customer business entity. The customer needs to save this information: name, birthday, age, sex, and phone. The data is stored in client.db, and there is a judgement whether the customer table exists. If it doesn’t, it needs to be created first. Querying is done by name; same for deleting. The program is required to be concise, easy to maintain, and not over-designed. The screen is realized through streamlit and sqlite—no need to introduce other additional packages."}
